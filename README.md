# CmdLinux
The application is focused to be executed on Linux using the C programming language.
"We worked with processes, pipes, and other related topics with the goal of simulating a Linux shell. When a command is entered, the application will automatically execute it as it would in a Linux environment. The entire project is focused on operating systems."
